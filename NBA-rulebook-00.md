## 1999-00

- In the backcourt, there is no contact with hands and forearms by defenders. In the frontcourt, there is no contact with hands and forearms by defenders except below the free throw line extended in which case the defender may only use his forearm. In the post, neither the offensive player nor the defender is allowed to dislodge or displace a player who has legally obtained a position. Defender may not use his forearm, shoulder, hip or hand to reroute or hold-up an offensive player going from point A to point B or one who is attempting to come around a legal screen set by another offensive player. Slowing or impeding the progress of the screener by grabbing, clutching, holding “chucking” or “wrapping up” is prohibited.

- The official(s) will visually commence a five-second count if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded; or if he starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. The five-second count commences when the offensive player penetrates the free throw line extended. The penalty is the offensive team’s loss of possession of the ball.

- If the shot clock is below 14 seconds, it is recycled to 14 seconds when a kicked ball, a punched ball, a common foul requiring no free throw attempts or an illegal defense requiring no free throw attempts occurs.

- Any defense is legal on the strong side. Defenders must remain on the weak side outside the paint unless they are double-teaming the ball, picking up a free cutter or closely guarding an offensive player.

## 2000-01

- The number of timeouts per team per game was changed to six from seven.

- The number of fourth-period timeouts per team was changed to three from four.

- The number of timeouts per team during the last two minutes of the fourth period or last two minutes of an overtime period was changed to two from three.
- Full timeouts in regulation and overtime will be reduced from 100 to 60 seconds with the following exceptions: (1) the first two timeouts in each period, regardless of which team calls them. (2) the two mandatory timeouts in the second and fourth periods. In those two instances, timeouts will continue to be 100 seconds.
Previously all full timeouts were 100 seconds.

- During 20-second timeouts in the last two minutes of the fourth period and/or any overtime period there are unlimited substitutions. Previously the team calling the timeout could substitute one player. The other team could substitute only if the team calling timeout substituted.

- After a change of possession in the last two minutes of regulation or any overtime period, the offensive team can call a regular or 20-second timeout and advance the ball to midcourt. The team has the option of inbounding the ball in the frontcourt or backcourt. If it passes into the backcourt, the 10-second rule applies. 
Previously teams could advance the ball only by calling a regular timeout and had to inbound the ball into the frontcourt.

- If neither team has taken a timeout in the second and fourth quarter when there is 8:59 remaining, there will be a mandatory timeout after the first dead ball. If neither team has taken a timeout in all four periods when there is 5:59 remaining, there will be a mandatory timeout after the first dead ball. Previously, timeouts were taken after dead balls after 9:59 in the second and fourth periods and after 6:59 in every period.

- If the offense retains possession after a jump ball, the clock is reset to 14 seconds or remains the same if there are more than 14 seconds on the clock. If the defense gains possession, the clock is reset to 24 seconds. Previously, if the offense retained possession, the clock was reset to 24 seconds.)

- If a player is fouled when he has a clear-path-to-the-basket, he gets one free throw and his team gets possession of the ball at midcourt. 
Previously, the player received two free throws.

- No contact with either hands or forearms by defenders except in the frontcourt below the free throw line extended in which case the defender may use his forearm only.

- Neither the offensive player nor the defender will be allowed to dislodge or displace a player who has legally obtained a position.

- Defender may not use his forearm, shoulder, hip or hand to reroute or hold-up an offensive player going from point A to Point B or one who is attempting to come around a legal screen set by another offensive player.

- Slowing or impeding the progress of the screener by grabbing, clutching, holding “chucking” or “wrapping up” is prohibited.

- A five-second count will begin if an offensive player with the ball and not facing-up starts dribbling below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded or starts dribbling outside and then penetrates below the free throw line extended while being closely guarded. (The five-second count commences when the offensive player penetrates the free throw line extended). After five seconds, a violation will have occurred and the offensive team will lose possession.

- The shot clock shall remain as it is or be recycled to 14 seconds if it is below 14 for a common foul requiring no free throw attempts occurs, kicked or punched ball violation, or an illegal defense requiring no free throw attempts.

- On the strongside, any defense is legal.

- On the weakside, defenders must remain on the weakside outside the paint unless (i) they are double-teaming the ball, (ii) picking up a free cutter or (iii) closely guarding an offensive player.

## 2001-02

- Illegal defense guidelines will be eliminated in their entirety.
- A new defensive three-second rule will prohibit a defensive player from remaining in the lane for more than three consecutive seconds without closely guarding an offensive player.
- The time that a team has to advance the ball past midcourt will be reduced from ten seconds to eight.
- Brief contact initiated by a defensive player will be allowed if it does not impede the progress of the player with the ball.

## 2002-03

- Use of instant replay to review certain last-second plays at the end of each quarter and overtime periods. Replays will be conducted and processed in two minutes or less by the game officials. Replays are triggered automatically – and not at the discretion of the officials or teams.

- Instant replay will also be used when: (1) A foul for which the resulting free throws could affect the outcome of the game is called with no time remaining on the clock (0:00) at the end of the fourth quarter or any overtime period or (2) A foul is called with no time remaining on the clock (0:00) at the end of the first, second and third quarters.
In these situations, officials will review instant replay to determine only whether the called foul occurred prior to the expiration of time on the game clock and not whether the call itself was correct.

## 2003-04

- For a 20-Second Timeout, the official shall instruct the timer to record the 20 seconds and to inform him when the time has expired. 

- If a team calls a 20-second timeout because one of its players is injured and, at the expiration of the 20-second timeout limit, play is unable to resume due to that player's injury, a full timeout will be charged to that team and 20-second timeout returned.

- The 24-second clock shall remain the same as when play was interrupted or reset to 5 seconds, whichever is greater, any time on jump balls retained by the offensive team as the result of a held ball caused by the defense.

## 2004-05

- New rules were introduced to curtail hand-checking, clarify blocking fouls and call defensive three seconds to open up the game.

## 2006-07

- The head coach may request a timeout (20-second or full) at any time during a game as long as his team has possession of the ball or there is a suspension of play.

- Free substitution is permitted during all 20-second timeouts.

- On a clear-path-to-the-basket foul, the team that is fouled is awarded two free throw attempt and the ball on the sideline.

- If a player not listed on a team’s Active List participates in game play, the officials, upon noticing or being made aware of the ineligible player, will disqualify the player at the first dead ball and the player’s team will be assessed a technical foul.

- Players not occupying a lane space during a free- attempt must remain behind the three-point line and above the free-throw line extended until the ball is released by the free-throw shooter.

- If a flagrant foul/penalty 1 is called and the fouled player is unable due to injury to shoot his free-throws, his team’s coach (not the opposing team’s coach) selects a replacement free-throw shooter from among players on the floor (not players on the bench) at the time of the foul, and the injured player is not permitted to return to the game. 

- Note: The rules for unsportsmanlike acts (elbow and punching fouls) and flagrant fouls/penalty 2 state the fouled player’s coach selects the replacement free-throw shooter from any eligible player on his team (whether on the playing floor or the bench) and the injured player is permitted to re-enter the game following the free-throw attempts. There is no change to this rule.

## 2007-08

#### 1. Rule 2 Section IV. e - Block/Charge Clarification

If two officials differ on a block/charge foul involving the restricted area and/or lower defensive box, they will conference and share information in an attempt to make the correct call. If no resolution is reached it will be treated as a double foul (See rule 12B VI -f).

#### 2006-2007: Section IV- Different Decisions By Officials

a. The crew chief shall have the authority to set aside or question decisions regarding
a rule interpretation made by either of the other officials.
b. If two officials give conflicting signals as to who caused the ball to go out-of-bounds,
they will conference and reconstruct the play in an attempt to make the correct call. If no resolution
is reached, a jump ball will be signaled between the two players involved at the nearest
circle. If the two players cannot be identified, the jump ball shall be administered at the
center circle between any two opponents in the game. If one official signals and another official
clearly knows the call is incorrect, they should conference and the calling official may
change the call on the information given. However, if both officials are adamant about their
ruling, a jump ball should be held similar to above.
c. In the event that a violation and foul occur at the same time, the foul will take precedence.
d. Double Foul (See Rule 12-B-Section VI-f).

They are permitted between the 28' hash mark and the midcourt line to relay information
to players but must return to the bench side of the 28' hash mark immediately or be
called for a non-unsportsmanlike technical foul. A coach is not permitted to cross the midcourt
line and violators will be assessed an unsportsmanlike technical foul immediately. All
assistants and trainers must remain on the bench. Coaches and trainers are not permitted to
go to the scorer's table, for any reason, except during a dead ball.

	3. Rule 5 Section VII. a - Clarification on Full Timeouts in Last Two Minutes
	If a team has two (2) or three (3) full timeouts remaining when the fourth period reaches the 2:00 mark, one (1) of the timeouts will be changed to a 20-second timeout and they will retain only one (1) full timeout. Therefore, if a team has not yet used its allotted 20-second timeout for the second half, it shall have two 20-second timeouts at its disposal.

#### 2006-2007: Section VII-Regular Timeout-100/60 Seconds:
a. Each team is entitled to six (6) charged timeouts during regulation play. Each team is limited to no more than three (3) timeouts in the fourth period and no more than two (2) timeouts in the last two minutes of regulation play. (This is in addition to one 20-second timeout per half.)
4. Comments on Rules - Notes. - Blood Rule Modification
A team will not be given an additional 30 seconds should bleeding occur from a wound reopened which is not the result of additional contact.

forth in Comments on the Rules L. 

#### Rule 13 Section II - Instant Replay Additions
Flagrant Foul/Penalty 2:

Instant Replay will be utilized to determine:
- Whether the Flagrant Foul/Penalty 2 was called correctly or whether it should be downgraded to a Flagrant Foul/Penalty 1 or a Personal Foul.

shooter's feet at the moment they last touched the floor immediately prior to (or,
if applicable, during) the release of the shot.
(4) Whether the 24-second clock expired before the ball left the shooter's hand.
(5) Whether an 8-second backcourt violation occurred before the ball left the shooter's
hand.

any question whether the shooter committed a 24-second violation, 8-second violation or
boundary line violation where time may be added to the game clock.
e. The officials will keep both teams on the court anytime instant replay is used at the
end of the fourth period or overtime period.
